### Cmdlets are different from commands in other command-shell environments in the following manners −

- Cmdlets are .NET Framework class objects It can't be executed separately
- Cmdlets can construct from as few as a dozen lines of code
- Parsing, output formatting, and error presentation are not handled by cmdlets
- Cmdlets process works on objects. So text stream and objects can't be passed as output for pipelining
- Cmdlets are record-based as so it processes a single object at a time
- Most of the PowerShell functionality comes from Cmdlet's which is always in verb-noun format and not plural. Moreover, Cmdlet's return objects not text. A cmdlet is a series of commands, which is more than one line, stored in a text file with a .ps1 extension.


### A cmdlet always consists of a verb and a noun, separated with a hyphen. Some of the verbs use for you to learn PowerShell is:
```
Get — To get something
Start — To run something
Out — To output something
Stop — To stop something that is running
Set — To define something
New — To create something
```
