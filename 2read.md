- median VS average {

    `"... the difference between median and mean? This is an easy one: Mean is used to refer to arithmetic mean, one of the different types of mean. Mean and average are the same. They are synonyms ..."`: https://www.payscale.com/compensation-today/2011/11/mean-vs-median
    - ~~discreet VS continuous measurement~~
    - choice of best criteria depends of field of usage these terms (measurements)
    - depands of dataset size and it≈õ other statistics values
    - `"the mean or average is very sensitive to outliers (abnormally low or high values), while the median is much less affected by outliers."`

    - "While an `average` has traditionally been a popular measure of a mid-point in a sample, it `has the disadvantage of being affected by any single value being too high or too low compared to the rest of the sample`. This is why a median is sometimes taken as a better measure of a mid point."
    - "Applicability: The `mean is used for normal distributions`.	The `median is generally used for skewed distributions`."
    - calculating of the meAn is simpler VS founding the meDian [math-expression VS sorting]
    - "in case of `an even number of observations`, there is no single middle value, so it is a usual practice to take the mean of the `two middle values`."

    - `The disadvantage: mean is not a robust statistic tool` since it cannot be applied to all distributions but is easily the most widely used statistic tool to derive the central tendency. The reason that mean cannot be applied to all distributions is because it gets unduly impacted by values in the sample that are too small to too large. `The disadvantage: median is that it is difficult to handle theoretically`. There is no easy mathematical formula to calculate the median.
    - The `arithmetic mean`, [geometric mean](https://static.diffen.com/uploadz/math/c/9/8/c982938aa16f0782fa52d6a92afecc48.png) and [harmonic mean](https://static.diffen.com/uploadz/math/5/f/4/5f4eaad9f41faac3476425e2fb7a58d6.png) together form a set of means called the [Pythagorean means](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_means).
