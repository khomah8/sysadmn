#### HTTP connection explained : 
  - The _persistent network connection_ allows the client and server to send/receive multiple HTTP requests/responses without opening a new connection for every single request/response pair.
  - Persistent connections _can improve overall system performance_ by eliminating the need to send additional TCP/IP packets for establishing and closing the network connection before/after each request.
  - The connection is _persistent by default for HTTP/1.1__ clients. _For HTTP/1.0 connections_, you need to explicitly indicate that you want a persistent connection by adding the `"Connection: keep-alive"` header.
  - A client can inform the server that it doesn't need a persistent connection by sending the `"Connection: close"` header, thereby freeing up server resources. For example, if the client does not plan to send more than one request to this server.
  - If the server _does not support persistent connections or cannot provide_ a persistent connection at this time, it can indicate this by sending the `"Connection: close"` _header in the response_.

#### Apache Kafka : [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Kafka); [GitHub](https://github.com/apache/kafka)
> Apache Kafka is an open-source stream-processing software platform developed by the Apache Software Foundation, written in Scala and Java. The project aims to provide a unified, high-throughput, low-latency platform for handling real-time data feeds. Kafka can connect to external systems (for data import/export) via Kafka Connect and provides Kafka Streams, a Java stream processing library. Kafka uses a binary TCP-based protocol... 
> We can use Kafka as a __Message Queue or a Messaging System__ but as a distributed streaming platform Kafka has several other usages for stream processing or storing data. Messaging System: a __highly scalable, fault-tolerant and distributed Publish/Subscribe__ messaging system. 
> In short, Kafka is used for stream processing, __website activity tracking, metrics collection and monitoring, log aggregation, real-time analytics__, CEP, ingesting data into Spark, ingesting data into Hadoop, CQRS, replay messages, error recovery, and guaranteed distributed commit log for in-memory computing... 
> Kafka provides a __framework for storing, reading and analysing streaming data__... was originally created at LinkedIn, where it played a part in __analysing the connections between their millions of professional users__ in order to build networks between people.

- SRE (concept): { 
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site_reliability_engineering: { 

__SRE satisfies `the DevOps [five] pillars` as follows:__ 
1) Reduce `organizational silos`
    - SRE shares ownership with developers to create shared responsibility
    - SREs use the same tools that developers use, and vice versa
2) Accept `failure as normal`
    - SREs embrace risk[6]
    - SRE quantifies failure and availability in a prescriptive manner using [Service Level Indicators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_Level_Indicator) (SLIs) and [Service Level Objectives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-level_objective) (SLOs)
    - SRE mandates blameless post mortems
3) Implement `gradual changes`
    - SRE encourages developers and product owners to move quickly by reducing the cost of failure
4) Leverage `tooling and automation`
    - SREs have a charter to automate manual tasks (called "toil") away 
5) `Measure everything`prtg
    - SRE defines prescriptive ways to measure values
    - SRE fundamentally believes that systems operation is a software problem
