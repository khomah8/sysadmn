### pagerduty _vs_ victorops _vs_ opsgenie 

comparision: {

	https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/g34drp/pagerduty_vs_victorops_vs_opsgenie/: {
		- whether or not you have a mature incident management procedures,,
		- [ Victor Ops (prior to Splunk acquiring them) was very no frills, cost was good, but features; Ops Genie (prior to them getting acquired by Atlassian) was a good middle ground ],,
		- [ 10 months ago We switched from Pagerduty to Opsgenie about 2 years ago. The main driver was price, Opsgenie was about half the cost of Pagerduty; In PagerDuty you had every alert received turn into a page. With Opsgenie you can autoclose, filter to different teams etc. It also means you can share an API endpoint between different levels of alerts or even different teams; Possibly PagerDuty has improved since but they mostly seemed to concentrate on the reporting tools (probably because the senior managers were the ones making the buying decisions). ],,
		- I‚Äôd take a look at xMatters as well, they‚Äôre in the same category and have some decent features and you can do all sorts of cool tricks with the calendaring/shifts.,,
		- You should definitely check out Squadcast - https://www.squadcast.com/
		Its way better than PD or OpsGenie for a bunch of reasons. Completely free to use for up to 10 users - Their platform is the easiest to work with, and their team truly empathises with the pains of being on-call.,,
		- reducing lot of oncall noise,,
		- We use OpsGenie and we haven't had any problems. We have integrations going with Azure, Prometheus, and PRTG (among others).,,
		- We were a PagerDuty shop and within the last 6 months moved to OpsGenie. There are definitely a few things I miss from PD - like auto refresh on the alerts page or reassigning an alert to a different team, but overall there's just way more flexibility with OpsGenie, and the price is much nicer.,,
		- One thing I can vouch for in terms of PagerDuty is the API they provide - building internal tools such as Slack bots from their API is really nice and seamless.,,
		- Do also check out Zenduty if you're looking for a more end-to-end incident alerting and response solution,,
		- I work for OnPage ( https://www.onpage.com/incident-alert-management-for-it/ ) and we operate within IT alerting and incident orchestration.,,
