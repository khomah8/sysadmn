## New Employee On-boarding: Buddy Program and Guidelines
### What is a Buddy?

A buddy is a team member who partners with a new employee during their first 3-6 months on the job. They offer advice, resources, and guidance regarding the day-to-day aspects of the work. They may also offer encouragement and suggestions as they introduce the new employee to the organizational culture.

### Why have a Buddy?
Assigning new employees a buddy provides them with a trusted and motivated person that is not their direct manager, who will help them feel welcome. A buddy helps to reduce the initial confusion and uncertainty faced by all new employees and increase their ability to contribute to the department and organization and have a better understanding of the work environment.

#### Hiring (direct) Managers
You are responsible for selecting a buddy for your new employee. Selection should be based on the following characteristics:

- Demonstration of high performance
- Is willing and able to be accessible to the new employee
- Is skilled or knowledgeable about the new employee’s job
- Is proud of the organization
- Is a peer of the new employee
- Has patience, and good communication and interpersonal skills
- Wants to be a “buddy”
- Is a role model and well regarded and respected by team members
- Has been selected in advance and trained in their responsibilities

### Buddies
- Responsibilities
	-  Be a contact for general information on policies, procedures, work rules, norms, day-to-day operational issues, etc.
	- Help the new employee integrate with the department and organization regarding its culture, norms, and expectations.
	- Make introductions and help establish work networks
	- Assist in training
	- Provide a positive communication- this can include meeting for lunch, brief chats, accompanying them to a meetings if needed, etc.
	
- Formal Relationship – 3 months
Day One – meet your new employee on their first day.
Weekly meetings (can be informal)– 5–15 minutes in duration, or longer as needed
Call/email questions as needed. Buddy to set acceptable parameters.

- Informal Relationship – 3-6 months, or longer
The buddy can provide continued support beyond the initial 3 months if desired by both the buddy and the employee.

### What a Buddy is Not
A buddy is not a mentor or a manager.
- Mentor: Someone, typically more experienced, who is involved with the overall development of an individual (personal and professional).
- Manager: Someone responsible for the employee’s job performance and development. The manager resolves work-related issues.

### Having a Buddy is a Win/Win/Win Solution
This offers significant benefits to the new employee, the buddy, and organization:
