> webhooks [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook) 

- one of a few ways web applications can communicate with each other. It allows you to send real-time data from one application to another whenever a given event occurs. For example, let's say you've created an application using the Foursquare API that tracks when people check into your restaurant.

- in web development is a method of augmenting or altering the behavior of a web page or web application with custom callbacks. These callbacks may be maintained, modified, and managed by third-party users and developers who may not necessarily be affiliated with the originating website or application. The term "webhook" was coined by Jeff Lindsay in 2007 from the computer programming term hook.
